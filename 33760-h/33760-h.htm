<h3>AN INSTANCE OF THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF "PURE SCIENCE"</h3>


<p>The practical value of the service of the geological profession is, with
every year, being more and more appreciated, especially among people who
are developing the mineral resources of our country. Nevertheless, we
still hear men who speak of geologists as theorists that render our
profitable industries but little assistance. It is true that much of the
work that geologists do has but a remote bearing on practical questions.
The fact is that in geology, as in other sciences, one can never know
when a purely scientific observation may turn out to have a practical
application. Paleontologists who study the minutest details of fossils
have been held up as impractical people, even though their science has
more than once proved to be of the greatest practical importance for the
finding of valuable natural deposits. Certainly those who have been most
prominent in the promotion of paleontology as a science have seldom, if
ever, had any economic motive in the pursuit of their work. I think the
same is true of our leading petrographers. I believe that the men who
have advanced the science of geology most, have seldom contributed much
to the practical application of the principles they have discovered.
Much scientific work naturally appears unprofitable or useless to the
uninitiated. I shall here relate a case that suggests how entirely wrong
it may be to regard as of no economic value any geologic fact, however
insignificant it may appear.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1890 I took occasion to make a trip to the Black Hills
in South Dakota in order to profit, as I could, by a few weeks' tramping
in this interesting region. Going one day in a southwest direction from
Minnekahta, to look for fossil cycads, I stumbled on a block of
sandstone with a rather smooth surface on which were some peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4"></a>[p.4]</span>markings, such as I had never seen figured or described. The
rock was evidently a block from the Dakota sandstone. Its smooth upper
surface, which represented a bedding plane, was covered with a thin
coating of silt or fine clay which adhered to the block. The markings
were in this clay. They were straight, shallow grooves from one-half to
two inches in length, and from one-sixteenth to one-eighth inch in
width. They were joined into patterns in which some sprang out from the
sides of others and again themselves sent out other branches. Some
crossed each other. I noticed that there was a quite uniform angle of
divergence in these branches, and I was able to make out that this usual
angle was about sixty degrees. I also noted that the grooves narrowed to
sharp points. Somehow, immediately I concluded that the cracks were the
result of ice crystals, and I at once saw the propriety of frozen water
having existed in an age during which deciduous trees began to appear.
This was theory. We have since that time learned to know that cold
climates far antedate the coming of the dicotyledons.</p>

<p>As I had no suitable photographic equipment, I took pains to make
accurate drawings of a part of the pattern as it appeared on the rock.
My original drawing is shown in <a href="#img003">Plate I</a>. A brief description of these
markings was later furnished in the Scientific American, of February 19,
1895.</p>

<p>It took me some years to find any similar markings again. In the early
spring of 1903 I had occasion to make a visit to Mexico, when I spent a
half day in Ojinaga, which is a little village south of Presidio, in
Texas, on the Mexican side of the river. Some sidewalks in this little
village are built of flags of limestone belonging to the Eagle Ford
formation. To my great delight I found some of these slabs having
precisely the same kind of markings that I had noted on the sandstone in
Dakota. Naturally I attached some importance to the fact that the Eagle
Ford corresponds quite closely in age to that of the Dakota sandstone.
Both were made at about the beginning of the upper Cretaceous age. I
noticed here a considerable variation in the closeness of the patterns
of the markings. Occasionally they were found as separate single lines,
several inches removed from each <span class="pagenum"><a id="page5"></a>[p.5]</span>other; and on other rocks they
would be found crossing in close networks. In the summer of 1904 I again
found my ice markings on a layer of arenaceous limestone in the same
formation in the Big Bend country in Texas. This time I collected some
specimens which were subsequently photographed. One of these photographs
is shown in <a href="#img004">Plate II</a>. Again in 1906 I noticed the same markings on some
thin sandy flags which occur in the Del Rio clay near the city of Del
Rio. In this case the needle-like crystals were somewhat more slender
than those previously seen, and some were slightly curved and somewhat
more elongated. These of course interested me as showing the occurrence
of freezing temperatures no doubt at a somewhat earlier time than that
pertaining to my previous observations.</p>

<p>During all these years my residence was in Illinois, and I was naturally
watching for similar markings in recent mud, resulting from late and
early frosts. I found them in the fall of 1909. At this time some
excavations were being made in the loess in Rock Island, when some rains
fell in the late fall. These rains evidently happened to give the mud
the amount of moisture necessary for such crystals to develop, as the
ground froze. The rains had washed the loess extensively, and I found a
number of places where it lay redistributed, with a fairly smooth
surface. It was evident that the moisture content of the ground,
together with the temperature conditions, determined the size and the
closeness of the frozen patterns. In places the crystals were long and
slender, in others they were short and stout. At some points they were
straight and in others slightly curved. Here and there the patterns were
close enough to resemble the fine lines which we sometimes notice in the
hoarfrost on windowpanes. In other places the crystals occurred in
radiating groups, and elsewhere they would form scattered separate
units. For preserving a record of what I saw, I poured plaster over
several patterns and had these casts photographed, as appears in <a href="#img010">Plates
VIII</a>, <a href="#img011">IX</a>, <a href="#img012">X</a>. Placing these side by side with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page6"></a>[p.6]</span>the photographs of
the patterns I have photographed from the Eagle Ford, it appears to me
that no doubt can be left as to the origin of the markings found in the
fossil state.</p>

<p>Recently I have found that these ice crystal marks are quite common at
one horizon in the Eagle Ford beds of Brewster County, in Texas. There
is also a layer in which they can be usually seen in the vicinity of
Austin, Texas. This lies about twenty-five feet below the Austin Chalk,
near Austin. A like layer occurs about 100 feet below the Austin Chalk
in the Big Bend country. Here I have found the markings in localities
thirty miles apart. They occur at the north point of Mariscal Mountain
and in a number of places near the Fossil Knobs and on the Chisos Mining
Company property at Terlingua.</p>

<p>Unprofitable as observations on such a simple matter as this may seem, I
find that other geologists have given it some attention. Quite recently,
Dr. John M. Clarke<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> has figured slabs showing what has been described
as <i>Fucoides graphica</i>, by Hall. The markings figured by Professor
Clarke are undoubtedly of the same kind as those I have found in the
Eagle Ford. They occur in the Upper Devonian in New York. I also find
that the formation of ice crystals in wet mud has been observed in the
clays about Boston by Marbut and Woodworth.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Other observations of
similar recent markings are said to have been made by some English
geologists.</p>

<p>To "practical people" it may indeed appear that no more unprofitable or
more idle curiosity could be indulged in, than making observations on
what kind of crystals are formed when water freezes in mud. I must
confess that my own first observations had no motive whatever, except
for the desire to know something new; and I never expected that anything
I could learn about these fossil marks would ever turn out to have any
practical application, at least not in my own work.</p>

<p class="marbot3"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page7"></a>[p.7]</span>But it has turned out differently. For some time, I have been
called upon occasionally to advise with regard to the finding of the ore
in one of our quicksilver mines in West Texas. It is now a well
established fact that the distribution of the ore in this mine, and I
believe in the entire Terlingua district, bears a definite relation to
geological horizons. Successful mining requires search in these
horizons. The cinnabar, as it appears, has accumulated in greatest
quantity under impervious rocks such as shales and marls along planes
that separate these from underlying rocks of more open texture, mostly
limestones. The ore has clearly come from below and has risen through
fissure planes, which in some cases separate large blocks of the
Cretaceous formations. The best ore has been found under the basal part
of the Boquillas flags, and under the Del Rio clay in the upper part of
the Georgetown limestone. The workings must be so arranged in the mine
that these horizons can be entered on both sides of a fault fissure. The
problem of locating the depth of the desirable horizons in the mine in
question would be easy enough, if it were not for the fact that the
outcropping rocks consist of a series of sediments with few
characteristic fossils. Most of the fossils which occur extend through a
range of several hundred feet and the beds themselves are quite uniform
in character, consisting of alternating thin layers of impure limestones
and marls. An attempt was made to correlate the outcropping beds by
close examination of the layers exposed, but the result was not very
satisfactory. A close scrutiny made of each layer on the section
resulted, however, in the finding of two features that enabled me to
measure the throw of the fault under investigation. Interbedded in the
Boquillas flags there are some thin layers of bentonite, which are quite
persistent and can be followed for several miles. By comparing the
distances between these layers and by taking note of their individual
thickness, it was possible to make a correlation that seemed to be
correct. But the proof sought fell just short of being certain. In cases
of this kind one always looks for corroborating facts to check one's
conclusions. I found this check in the discovery of the layer which
carries ice crystal markings <span class="pagenum"><a id="page8"></a>[p.8]</span>in these beds. The layer had a
definite relation to the seams of bentonite, and, with this additional
evidence, I was confident there was no possible chance of a mistake. It
enabled me to locate not only the right horizon but also a horizon in
the underlying heavy Comanchean limestone, which is water-bearing, and
which must be avoided to prevent serious injury to the underground
operations. I need not add that the information obtained was of real
practical value in this case.</p>

In the locality where this cast was made, the crystals were relatively
slender, distant, and some gently curved, like those seen in <a href="#img007">Plate V</a><span class="wosp05">.
Slightly</span> reduced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page46"></a>[p.46]</span>Plate <span class="wosp05">X. Photograph</span> of a cast made by pouring plaster over a
surface of mud in which ice crystals had recently formed, in Rock
Island, Ill., and where they had later been removed by natural
sublimations into the atmosphere, leaving open cracks in the mud. It
will be seen that the crystal growth in this case involves an x-like or
radiating pattern formed of relatively very slender forms that almost
everywhere are very gently curved somewhat reminding of the slender
thread-like crystals sometimes seen in frost on windows. I have not yet
seen any similar fossil crystal growths as slender as <span class="wosp05">these. Slightly</span>
reduced.</p>
